#This is the Senior Project code for a suicide awareness web application.

#Things to do
- Create the basic html for the application
- See how it can be implemented into OpenUI5
- Integrate the existing html with openUI5 through the libraries and insertion

#Suggested technologies to use
###For the result page from decision tree

###For tree input
  https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/explored.html#/sample/sap.m.sample.ActionListItem/preview
  
###For transitions
  I suggest we use the slide implementation, it's not as informal as the spin navigation but cleaner than the fade animation

###For overall navigation
